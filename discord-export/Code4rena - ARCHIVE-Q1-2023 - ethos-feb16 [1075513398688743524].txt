I'm not too sure, I would consider it on a case by case basis. There's a lot of lines within the Liquity codebase that we haven't touched/edited that already have notes on it saying "Slither compains xyz but we did it this way because of abc..."

especially we've modified the system to work with any erc20 collateral with any arbitrary number of decimals, so non-18 decimal collaterals (such as WBTC) would also be a good hunting ground

Under known issues: 
`There is a loss of precision in line 112 of CommunityIssuance.sol. Though we consider this out of the contest's scope, we are open to field arguments for implementation changes under the QA bucket of rewards.`

I have an implementation which appears to address this issue. What should I do?


[02/16/2023 23:42] 0xbebis
if it's not just calling balanceOf and then adding it to the funding amount then you can go through typical channels


[02/16/2023 23:42] 0xbebis
implementation change i think would require better internal accounting as opposed to scooping up the balance of address(this)

What is *rehypothecation*?


[02/17/2023 04:12] tess3rac7
loaning out assets.. sort of what banks do with the assets on their balance sheet

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02/17/2023 04:13] tess3rac7
it basically means that we don't just keep idle collateral sitting in our system; we try to loan it out to another system (the vault) to make more money using that capital. The vault takes a small fee (from the rewards, NOT from the principal), and we have the flexibility to take out the principal and any accrued rewards (minus fee) per our discretion.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02/17/2023 04:14] tess3rac7
this obviously introduces additional smart contract risk (vault + strategy + the protocol that the vault is using to generate yield), as well as additional accounting risk (the interaction/rebalancing of capital between ActivePool contract and the vault)

GM, I would assume so, but a confirmation from the team would be appreciated on this topic.


[02/17/2023 10:15] dontonka
I was wondering about that, as an user/investor of the system, your documentation say low risk strategies, but how can we know what you will be using to generated yield in the rehypothecation? For ETH, I would assume its the safest and cleaned as one strategy would be to stake it through rocketpool or you own validators, but that would generate 3-4% pure yield at most. I'm seeing a lot of your yield above that, I assume its because there are some subsidization of $ERN in the system too (issuance) ? I would be curious what it would be for BTC for example. Also if those stategies are in the code base (like to witch protocol you use etc)?


[02/17/2023 10:37] matin6517
Hello dear friends,
I was wondering if someone could help me understand the difference between MCR and CCR in CDP-backed stablecoins.
As far as I know, should the MCR be higher than CCR or vice versa?ü§î

inside the repo, the Ethos-Vault directory has the exact strategy that is live. You can also look at the live Vault code at the links mentioned here https://docs.reaper.farm/ethos-reserve-bounty-hunter-documentation/contracts-in-scope/reapervaultv2 and navigate to their strategies.

The strategies are currently supplying to Granary, which is a lending/borrowing protocol also owned and operated by the Byte Masons.

MCR (minimum collateralization ratio) is minimum CR at which you're allowed to open a trove while the system is in normal mode. Normal mode means that the total CR (across the whole market) is over the CCR (critical collateralization ratio).

So for example, for the WBTC market, MCR is 120% and CCR is 150%. What this means is that as long as the total CR of the WBTC market is at least 150%, individual troves can fall as low as 120% and not be liquidated. But if the total CR of the market falls below 150%, recovery mode kicks in, and then there's special operations that are allowed (liquidating troves up to `debt * MCR`) on troves that sit between MCR and CCR. Basically, recovery mode turns on "strict mode" so that the system can push itself out of recovery mode as soon as possible.

Those repos aren't public yet but they're also a bit outdated. We've made more changes since we completed the certik audit and the contest repo has the latest codebase. However, I can provide you with a summary of the changes between those two commits:
- Adds `pauseMinting()` `unpauseMinting()` `updateGovernance()` `updateGuardian()` and `upgradeProtocol()` to LUSDToken.sol
- Addresses EIP-2612 signature malleability by adding a check for the valid range of `s` at the beginning of `permit()` function inside LUSDToken.sol
- Adds some more events as well as messages to require statements
- Adds `updateCollateralRatios` function to CollateralConfig.sol 

Hopefully that's good enough for you, let me know if you have more questions üôè

You can find a comment about this below in the code.


[02/18/2023 13:33] janio2023
as far as I understood it is. They will probably spare gas by not inheriting Ownable anymore. And ownership would be necessary only until setting the addresses (only to call setAddress once)


[02/18/2023 13:35] pfapostol
I think it's not about saving gas, but about bypassing solidity errors.

look at lusdtoken contract.. collateral can be added overtime. so far on OP they deployed wBTC and OP token.

hmm can i clarify why look at lusdtoken contract?
my impression so far is the collateral types will be immutable..

we removed it because TroveManager repeatedly gave us contract size issues. The only use for ownable was to be able to setAddresses and renounce ownership right away, so we just decided to use our own simple `owner` variable to save on contract size.

Mostly WBTC and WETH with perhaps an additional token (for example the chain's token).


[02/18/2023 15:20] tess3rac7
this is correct; collateral types are immutable once initialized. The only mutability is that a collateral's MCR and CCR can be walked down (only down, not up), as seen in the `CollateralConfig` contract. 

there is another path whereby the whole protocol can be upgraded to a new version (see `upgradeProtocol()` inside LUSDToken), which would allow us to establish a new system and reinitialize it with new collaterals (and reuse the same instance of LUSDToken)

[02/18/2023 16:39] doublesharp
`approve` is for authorizing contracts to spend your tokens, `permit` uses an offchain signature to create the approval.

Can someone explain what's the purpose of the OATH token ? I'm not understanding it purpose.


[02/18/2023 17:55] 0xbebis
Oath is converted to an 80/20 balancer pool token and staked to earn fees from the platform. This ensures that there is always liquidity to trade from the farmed assets to $OATH, which is then sent to CommunityIssuance to reward stability pool depositors.


[02/18/2023 17:55] 0xbebis
the idea here is instead of minting Oath for incentives, it's rebought using yield generated by the platform then distributed

Oracles have historically been a soft spot for protocols


[02/18/2023 23:38] tess3rac7
Good point. Justin and I had a lot of difficulty narrowing the scope because once we started including all the contracts there was no end and it just kept getting bigger and bigger. 

Ultimately we decided to focus first and foremost on the contracts we heavily edited compared to the original LQTY codebase, and that didn't have as numerous and extensive unit tests as the rest of the codebase.

PriceFeed has many, many unit tests covering the logic extensively AND we haven't changed any of the actual oracle logic compared to the Liquity codebase. We've just added the ability to upgrade the oracle addresses should we ever need to, and used newer Tellor schematics with 18 digit precision and time delay.

That being said, if a bounty hunter found something in PriceFeed that exposed a vulnerability we would most definitely consider it. Hope this is a somewhat satisfactory answer üôÇ

correct, only `borrowerOperations` is authorized to allow trove opening/adjustment operations. It's the single interface in the system designed for borrowers.


[02/19/2023 15:32] 0xjuntao
I dont understancd, but openTrove and adjustTrove are external functions, everyone is able to call


[02/19/2023 15:34] tess3rac7
Might be a good starting point to understand how the system stores the aggregated collateral for each market: https://github.com/liquity/dev#flow-of-ether-in-liquity

ActivePool: stores collateral from all the active troves
DefaultPool: stores collateral (temporarily) that was received from a liquidation--a liquidation when there wasn't enough ERN in the stability pool, so the liquidation happened via redistribution https://github.com/liquity/dev#redistributions-and-corrected-stakes
CollSurplusPool: stores collaterals from troves that were either redeemed against or troves that were liquidated with ICR > MCR in recovery mode. This is excess collateral that is claimable later by the borrower.

another good way to think about it:
ActivePool - active (good standing troves) collateral
DefaultPool - defaulters (bad debt) collateral that couldn't be immediately wiped with ERN
CollSurplusPool - redeemable collateral for borrowers that weren't quite in bad standing but other forces in the system caused their trove to close, so we let them have their excess collateral back

`RedemptionHelper` has all the code related to redemptions only. In the original Liquity codebase, this code is found inside `TroveManager`, however, due to contract size issues, we cut-pasted that code into a new file (`RedemptionHelper`), and made the `redeemCollateral()` pass through to it. As such, we have not edited the redemption code and there are many, many unit tests covering that functionality.

Hi, when checking the ReaperVaultV2 contract, the description says "A EIP4626-compitable vault that can operate multiple yield-generating strategies at the same time. The ActivePool contract will integrate with one instance of ReaperVaultV2 per collateral as a means of generating passive yield on otherwise dormant assets within the system." When it says instance per collateral, does it mean one instance per collateral type, or literally one instance per collateral placed by user?

One the core principles of the vault/strategy architecture is to have suspicion between the vault and the strategy. What I mean by this is that the vault doesn't just take the strategy's word for "this is how much money I have." The vault instead behaves like a loan shark and keeps its own internal accounting of the amount of money lent to the strategy. 

It's only in the `report` function that the vault trusts the strategy minimally, by taking the strategy's word for `roi` and `repayment`. The sum of these two *should* at least equal want balance within the strategy, but the vault would rather just trust the arguments it was invoked with.

You can sort of see this here in the yearn vault code, which is what we adapted to build our own vaults: https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults/blob/master/contracts/Vault.vy#L1729

Hey all, just to clarify, the current collaterals of the live system are WETH and WBTC, and these cannot be changed once the system has been initialized. Our final live deployment might have the exact same collaterals, or it may possibly have an additional collateral.

*However, the system is not designed to accept ERC20s that have unusual behaviors such as rebasing or fee on transfer or any other quirks. We're only looking at high quality, large market cap, blue chip collateral.*

Hopefully this clarifies regarding the types of collaterals that the system will work with, so wardens can only focus on those when thinking of attack surfaces.

Just reporting an improvement todo in the front end.. i just tried that but the tx failed `'BorrowerOperations: Insufficient user collateral balance'` which is expected I have no WETH in my wallet, only ETH, but was not sure i did need to wrap those, now its clear XD. 

But as a user its always annoying to waste GAS when the UI could have prevented me initiate the transaction. So the front-end should only enable the button `Open Position` if also the amount of collateral specific is <= of what the user have in the connected wallet, does that make sense?

assuming you're talking about the asset management rebalancing between active pool and vault, this is net new functionality that we added and as such liquity doesn't have any documentation on it. I think the comments in the function are designed to be easy to follow along, but you can also look at PoolsTest for some examples.

We've already had 2 testnet deployments in the past couple months that we've tested internally.

We've reduced the min amount of debt needed to open a trove to just $10 for this live deployment.

I have a question about the collateral. The only contract which can update the collateral amount or specifically the collAmount mapping is the activePool.sol contract?

Can I do the same test on a testnet


[02/22/2023 14:40] dontonka
im not sure, their app would need to be deployed on a testnet or you do it yourself which might not be trivial.. as they mention they did this test on testnet in the past, that's why they wanted to be on mainnet.. if you want to test, its not much, with less then 50$ you can play with it.. (tranfering funds from ETH to OP will cost you 12-15$ in gas if you don't have funds already), on on OP, gas fees as you know are pretty low. and in the end you can get back your funds most likely.

Didn't see this in the glossary, but what does MCR mean in the Liquidation Logic section?


[02/22/2023 15:34] tess3rac7
it accepts OATH funding through the `fund()` and aims to distribute that OATH evenly spread throughout 14 days
the accounting is updated every time `issueOath()` is called by the stability pool
Note that the OATH that's "issued" to the stability pool still remains within the community issuance contract until the stability pool instructs it to actually pay out gains to a user

there's not a lot more to document to be honest

minimum collateral ratio, if you look at the collateralConfig contract, each collateral has an MCR and a CCR. MCR is the minimum below which a trove becomes liquidatable in normal mode

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02/22/2023 15:39] tess3rac7
so for WBTC, MCR = 120% and CCR = 150%; This means that as long as the total collateralization of the WBTC market is above 150%, you can open an individual trove with CR as low as 120%. But when TCR of the WBTC market falls below 150%, troves above 120% may be liquidated to bring the TCR back above CCR.

Do you mean below?

When system enters recovery mode, troves **ABOVE** MCR may be liquidated to bring the TCR of the system back above CCR

[02/22/2023 16:18] _brolee
Ah okay, I was reading this line from the liquity github: "When a Trove falls below a minimum collateralization ratio (MCR) of 110%, it is considered under-collateralized, and is vulnerable to liquidation."

from what i understand its your fraction of the pool, so if you deposit 200 ERN, and there are 2000 ERN in the pool, you would get 10% of the issuance.. its a little more complicated how the calculation is done, but simply that seem to be it. happy from the team to correct my statement. code for this calculation is inside `getDepositorLQTYGain` and `_getLQTYGainFromSnapshots` from StabilityPool.sol.

I'm a little confused by the strategists in the `ReaperBaseStrategyv4` context. It seems like, from the vault's perspective, a 'strategist' is a contract whose intention is returning positive ROI.
But in the context of `ReaperBaseStrategyv4` there is a distinction between the admins of the contract and `strategists`, both being arrays of addresses. 
Are strategists there EOAs? Other contracts? Or smart wallets? 
Thanks.


[02/23/2023 20:34] tess3rac7
Strategy is a contract. Strategist is an EOA representing the human who authored the strategy.


[02/23/2023 20:35] tess3rac7
Strategist role is one of the many levels of access. Guardian is a higher role than strategist. Admin is higher. Default_admin_role is highest.


[02/23/2023 20:36] tess3rac7
Look at the function cascadingAccess


[02/23/2023 20:37] tess3rac7
Vault interfaces with strategies (smart contracts) to allocate capital and generate yield.

Strategists, like myself, can tweak parameteres within the vault/strategy contracts.

who is "_treasuryAddress" ?


[02/25/2023 21:56] koolexc
StabilityPool
> Users can deposit ERN in here, which gets utilized for providing quick and efficient liquidations for unhealthy troves
how is it utilized?


[02/25/2023 22:15] dontonka
When operations occurs in the application (opening trove, closing trove, etc), some contract (I think TroveManager) will be called and might liquidate trove that have a low CR (lower then critical ratio) or will liquidate those under minimum CR.. when a liquidation happen, the debt on the trove (ERN borrowed) needs to be paid back, that is not paid back by the borrower, he will not even know his trove has been liquidated until he check back the application.. so when such liquidation occurs, the debt is paid by the Stability Pool, then the collaterals from this liquidation will be distributed among the Stability Pool stakers to compensate the loss in ERN they will have. Contributing to the Stability Pool could be seen as an exchange for ERN to get cheaper collaterals in the end, plus receiving OATH token as a bonus. Kind of an imparment loss when providing liquidity on uniswap, cause the ERN you deposit will always trend toward 0 replaced by collaterals, plus the OATH as explained.


[02/25/2023 22:19] koolexc
Thank you for the detailed explanation!
What confused me a bit "quick liquidation" . Is there another way to liquidate not quickly or is this just to compare it with other lenders in the market from a business point of view ?


[02/26/2023 04:22] dec3ntraliz3d
External users have the option to initiate the liquidation of an under-collateralized trove by calling either the `liquidateTroves()` or `batchLiquidateTroves()` function.  However this is less efficient way compared to stability pool.

it's a multisig controlled by builders where part of the revenue from the vault is directed to

if not set to true, the default value of a solidity variable is false. any collaterals besides the ones that are explicity whitelisted are not allowed

Does this apply for all contracts that are not mentioned as out-of-scope ? I'm aware that the focus on what's listed in-scope though

Long shot but I have seen something similar in other projects if you are using windows with x32 binaries. Or your system has, say, only 4GB RAM memory. It can halt because of no memory. But by your command you probably have at least 16BG


[02/27/2023 15:09] peakbolt
thanks for the suggestions. Im using 64-bit Ubuntu VM on a Windows machine. Given it 12GB ram..


[02/27/2023 15:09] peakbolt
what did you guys use to run the full test without running out of memory?


[02/27/2023 15:14] aba1842
Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS x64 with 32 GB RAM, worked from the start, all tests, but a bit slow

Please does the Ethos Reserve make use of upgradeable contracts?


[02/27/2023 19:37] tess3rac7
It doesn't use upgradeable contracts, but the protocol itself can be upgraded via a new deployment


[02/27/2023 19:40] matin6517
The `ReaperStrategyGranarySupplyOnly ` inherits the OpenZeppelins' UUPS, am I right?


[02/27/2023 19:42] tess3rac7
That's the vault side of things. Not the core Ethos Reserve protocol.


[02/27/2023 19:42] tess3rac7
But yes, the strategies of the vault do use UUPS


[02/27/2023 19:46] 0xchinedu
I think both the valut and core are part of the Ethos Reserve


[02/27/2023 19:55] tess3rac7
one could technically deploy the protocol with 0% allocated to vaults. vaults aren't necessary for the core functionality of the system. one could also not add any strategies to the vault, or add non-upgradeable strategies to the vault (UUPS is only used for the strategy, not the vault).


[02/27/2023 19:56] tess3rac7
but yes, the system will ideally be >0% allocated to vaults, and the vaults will have strategies that will likely be upgradeable. So what you're saying is also equally true perhaps

Either use the front-end or interact with the BorrowerOperations contract directly. You will have to approve it for the amount of collateral you wish to deposit and call the `openTrove` function.

if you entered the pool yesterday when F_LUSD was 10, and you staked 1000 tokens, and if today F_LUSD is 12, then your rewards are (12 - 10) * 1000

what are the tokens that might be used in ReaperVault2?


[03/02/2023 15:18] tess3rac7
`allocated` is the actual amount allocated to a strategy (example 500 WETH). `allocBPS` is the % (in basis points) of the vault's total assets that should be allocated to the strategy (example 3000 for 30%).


[03/02/2023 15:19] tess3rac7
`collAmount` tracks the entire collateral amount that is part of the ActivePool. This includes both assets in the ActivePool, as well as principal deposited into the vault. `yieldingAmount` is just the principal deposited into the vault.


[03/02/2023 15:19] tess3rac7
Same tokens as the collaterals


[03/02/2023 15:19] koolexc

Contest has ended, but curious to know what the ethos team will do after the USDC and DAI depeg.

@NickDrakon Our company is KYC'd with circle so if they don't restore the on-chain peg in a timely manner then we can redeem for $1 through their API.

If that becomes a problem then we swap to $ERN in a week or so and call our lawyers.

"Always redeemable for $1" is literally their tagline

hi, can someone review my submissions for ethos contract and help in learning why these were not valid?


[05/22/2023 12:54] lirios.
Findings repo is public so you can check there.  Normally judges add a comment when invalidating but this time it seems they have not.
My guess would be that 475 and 478 are out of scope as Owner is expected to only supply valid data.
479 is incorrect as this is no ETH transfer call but an ERC20 contract call. 480  is incorrect because sendOath is only called with _account = msg.sender so it can never be zero address, so check is not needed.
